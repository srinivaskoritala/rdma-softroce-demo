echo "CONCLUSION:"
echo "==========="
echo "RDMA RoCEv2 networks require meticulous tuning because:"
echo "1. Performance is critical - sub-microsecond latency and 100+ Gbps throughput"
echo "2. Complex interactions - multiple layers must work together perfectly"
echo "3. Hardware dependencies - specific NIC and switch configurations required"
echo "4. Application sensitivity - small misconfigurations cause massive performance loss"
echo "5. Network congestion - poor tuning leads to packet drops and failures"
echo
echo "Without proper tuning, you'll experience:"
echo "- 5-10x performance degradation"
echo "- Frequent network failures"
echo "- Application instability"
echo "- Resource exhaustion"
echo "- Service outages"
echo
echo "The investment in proper tuning pays off with:"
echo "- Optimal performance"
echo "- High reliability"
echo "- Predictable behavior"
echo "- Cost efficiency"
echo "- Competitive advantage"
echo
echo "Remember: RDMA is not 'plug and play' - it requires careful planning,"
echo "configuration, and ongoing maintenance to achieve its full potential."
